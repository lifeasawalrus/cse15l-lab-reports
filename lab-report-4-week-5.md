# Lab Report 4

The following are 3 examples of three different command-line options of "grep."

First, let's check out grep's `-i` option:
```
grep -i john technical/government/Post_Rate_Comm/*

```
`-i` shows results for the argument passed to grep, ignoring the case of each letter. So although I passed "john" it showed results for all instances of "John." This is especially helpful if you wanted to include every instance of your argument in the results, since captialized words that appeared at the beginning of a sentence would not be included without `-i`.

Notice that it showed each instance of "John" in context, presenting the path to the file each time. Let's clean up the output a bit by including the `-c` option.
```
grep -i -c john technical/government/Post_Rate_Comm/*
technical/government/Post_Rate_Comm/Cohenetal_Cost_Function.txt:4
technical/government/Post_Rate_Comm/Cohenetal_CreamSkimming.txt:1
technical/government/Post_Rate_Comm/Cohenetal_DeliveryCost.txt:3
technical/government/Post_Rate_Comm/Cohenetal_RuralDelivery.txt:1
technical/government/Post_Rate_Comm/Cohenetal_Scale.txt:2
technical/government/Post_Rate_Comm/Cohenetal_comparison.txt:7
technical/government/Post_Rate_Comm/Gleiman_EMASpeech.txt:1
technical/government/Post_Rate_Comm/Gleiman_gca2000.txt:3
technical/government/Post_Rate_Comm/Mitchell_6-17-Mit.txt:0
technical/government/Post_Rate_Comm/Mitchell_RMVancouver.txt:2
technical/government/Post_Rate_Comm/Mitchell_spyros-first-class.txt:0
technical/government/Post_Rate_Comm/Redacted_Study.txt:0
technical/government/Post_Rate_Comm/ReportToCongress2002WEB.txt:0
technical/government/Post_Rate_Comm/WolakSpeech_usps.txt:0
```
`-c` constricts the output of grep to just give the *count* of the argument passed to it, without spamming context or printing the file-path multiple times. This option is useful if you are trying to quickly and easily find out the number of instances a word appears in a directory.

`-n` is another helpful command:
```
rep -i -o -n john technical/government/Post_Rate_Comm/*
technical/government/Post_Rate_Comm/Cohenetal_Cost_Function.txt:20:John
technical/government/Post_Rate_Comm/Cohenetal_Cost_Function.txt:451:John
technical/government/Post_Rate_Comm/Cohenetal_Cost_Function.txt:454:John
technical/government/Post_Rate_Comm/Cohenetal_Cost_Function.txt:460:John
technical/government/Post_Rate_Comm/Cohenetal_CreamSkimming.txt:14:John
technical/government/Post_Rate_Comm/Cohenetal_DeliveryCost.txt:16:John
technical/government/Post_Rate_Comm/Cohenetal_DeliveryCost.txt:651:John
technical/government/Post_Rate_Comm/Cohenetal_DeliveryCost.txt:656:John

technical/government/Post_Rate_Comm/Cohenetal_comparison.txt:14:John
technical/government/Post_Rate_Comm/Cohenetal_comparison.txt:20:John
technical/government/Post_Rate_Comm/Cohenetal_comparison.txt:31:John
technical/government/Post_Rate_Comm/Cohenetal_comparison.txt:803:John
technical/government/Post_Rate_Comm/Cohenetal_comparison.txt:809:John
technical/government/Post_Rate_Comm/Cohenetal_comparison.txt:813:John
technical/government/Post_Rate_Comm/Cohenetal_comparison.txt:835:John
technical/government/Post_Rate_Comm/Gleiman_EMASpeech.txt:188:John
technical/government/Post_Rate_Comm/Gleiman_gca2000.txt:575:John
technical/government/Post_Rate_Comm/Gleiman_gca2000.txt:579:John
technical/government/Post_Rate_Comm/Gleiman_gca2000.txt:586:John
technical/government/Post_Rate_Comm/Mitchell_RMVancouver.txt:785:John
technical/government/Post_Rate_Comm/Mitchell_RMVancouver.txt:795:John
technical/government/Post_Rate_Comm/Mitchell_RMVancouver.txt:795:John
```
`-n` prints the *line number* that the argument was found on in the file. This is particularly helpful if you are searching code files for specific functions and want to find what line they are located on. (`-o` was used to reduce output of context to just the argument word)

Let's see a few more examples of these three options in action.
